# US 004 - To register the arrival of an SNS user

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

- As a receptionist at a vaccination center, I want to register the arrival of a SNS user to take the vaccine.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

#### From the specifications document:

- "When the SNS user arrives at the vaccination center, a receptionist registers the arrival of the user to
  take the respective vaccine."

- "The receptionist asks the SNS user for his/her SNS user number and
  confirms that he/she has the vaccine scheduled for the that day and time."

- "If the information is correct, the receptionist acknowledges the system that the user is ready to take the vaccine."

#### From the client clarifications :

>- **Question:** "Regarding US04, what are the attributes needed in order to register the arrival of a SNS user to a vaccination center".
>- **Answer:** The time of arrival should be registered.

>- **Question:** "Regarding US04, a receptionist register the arrival of a SNS user immediately when he arrives at the vaccination center or only after the receptionist confirms that the respective user has a vaccine schedule for that day and time."
>- **Answer:** The receptionist registers the arrival of a SNS user only after confirming that the user has a vaccine scheduled for that day and time.

>- **Question:** "The receptionist must have the possibility to choose which center she wants to register the SNS user's arrival every time she uses this feature, or should we make the nurse pick a center after they log in?"
>- **Answer:** To start using the application, the nurse should first select the vaccination center where she is working.

>- **Question:** "Regarding US04, the attribute "arrival time" should be considered to let the user enter the waiting room.
  For example, a user that arrives 40 minutes after his appointment wont be allowed to enter the center, and another who only arrives 10 minutes late may proceed. If so, how much compensation time should we provide to the user."
>- **Answer:** In this sprint we are not going to address the problem of delays. All arriving users are attended and registered by the receptionist.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1:** No duplicate entries should be possible for the same SNS user on the same day or vaccine period.
- **AC2:** Receptionist must first select a vaccination center where she is currently working before registering the arrival.
- **AC3:** Receptionist must first verify if the SNS user has a vaccine schedule for that day before registering the arrival.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- There is a dependency to "US001 and US002 : to schedule a vaccine" since the receptionist before registering the arrival of the SNS user, she must verify first if he/she has a vaccination schedule for that day and time.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

#### Input Data
- **Typed Data:**
  - SNS number
  - Time
  
- **Selected Data:**
  - Vaccination Center

#### Output Data
- Informs about if an SNS user has a vaccine schedule for that day or not.
- Informs about the success or failure of the operation.

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:
 * Company
 * Arrival
 * Vaccination Center
 * SNSUser
 * Vaccine Schedule

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * RegisterArrivalUI
 * SelVaccinationCenterUI
 * SelVaccinationCenterController
 * RegisterArrivalController
 * ArrivalStore
 * SNSUserStore
 * ScheduleVaccineStore
 * VaccinationCenterStore

# 4. Tests 

**Test 1:** Check that is possible to create an instance of the Arrival with valid values.

    @Test
        public void createValidArrival() {
        Arrival test = new Arrival(user, vaccCenter, "2022-05-28", "18:00");
        Assert.assertNotNull(test);
    }

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Arrival class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Arrival arrival = new Arrival(null, null, null, null);
	}

**Test 3:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Arrival class with invalid time format.

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureInvalidTimeFormatIsNotAllowed() {
		Arrival arrival = new Arrival(user, vaccCenter, "2022-05-28", "18:00:23");
	}

**Test 4:** Check the time format.

    @Test
		public void checkTimeFormat() {
		Arrival arrival;
        boolean test1 = arrival.checkTimeFormat("18:00");
        Assertions.assertTrue(test1);

        boolean test2 = arrival.checkTimeFormat("24:00");
        Assertions.assertFalse(test2);

        boolean test3 = arrival.checkTimeFormat("16:00:30");
        Assertions.assertFalse(test3);
	}
