# US 016 - To analyze the performance of a center

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

- As a center coordinator, I intend to analyze the performance of a center.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

#### From the specifications document:

>- "The goal of the performance
  analysis is to decrease the number of clients in the center, from the moment they register at the
 arrival, until the moment they receive the SMS informing they can leave the vaccination center."

>- "To evaluate this, it proceeds as follows: for any time interval on one day, the difference between the
  number of new clients arrival and the number of clients leaving the center every five-minute period
  is computed."

>- "In the case of a working day, with a center open from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m., a list with
  144 integers is obtained, where a positive integer means that in such a five-minute slot more clients
  arrive at the center for vaccination than clients leave with the vaccination process completed. A
  negative integer means the opposite." 

>- "So, the application should implement a bruteforce
  algorithm (an algorithm which examines all the contiguous subsequences) to determine the
  contiguous subsequence with maximum sum."

>- "The implemented algorithm should be analyzed in terms of its worst-case time complexity, and it should be compared to a benchmark algorithm
  provided."


#### From the client clarifications :

>- **Question:** "In US 16, should the coordinator have the option to choose which algorithm to run (e.g. via a configuration file or while running the application) in order to determine the goal sublist, or is the Benchmark Algorithm strictly for drawing comparisons with the Bruteforce one?"
>- **Answer:** The algorithm to run should be defined in a configuration file.

>- **Question:** "I would like to ask that if to analyse the performance of a center, we can assume (as a pre requirement) that the center coordinator was already attributed to a specific vaccination center and proceed with the US as so (like the center coordinator does not have to choose at a certain point where he is working. This is already treated before this US happens). Could you clarify this?"
>- **Answer:** A center coordinator can only coordinate one vaccination center. The center coordinator can only analyze the performance of the center that he coordinates.

>- **Question:** "I would like to know if we could strict the user to pick only those intervals (m) (i.e. 1, 5, 10, 20, 30) as options for analyzing the performance of a center, since picking intervals is dependent on the list which is 720/m (which the length is an integer result). If we let the user pick an interval that results in a non-integer result, this will result in an invalid list since some data for the performance analysis will be lost. Can you provide a clarification on this situation?"
>- **Answer:** The user can introduce any interval value. The system should validate the interval value introduced by the user.

>- **Question:** "From the Sprint D requirements it is possible to understand that we ought to implement a procedure that creates a list with the differences between the number of new clients arriving and the number of leaving clients for each time interval. My question then is, should this list strictly data from the legacy system (csv file from moodle which is loaded in US17), or should it also include data from our system?"
>- **Answer:** US 16 is for all the data that exists in the system.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1:** date format must be "dd/MM/yyyy"
- **AC2:** time interval must be in minutes
- **AC3:** The algorithm to run should be defined in a configuration file(Brute-force or Benchmark).
- **AC4:** The data used is of all system and not just the legacy system data.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

- There is a dependency to "US017 : to import data from the legacy system" since the center coordinator needs that data in order to analyze the performance of a center.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

#### Input Data
- **Typed Data:**
    - Date
    - Time Interval(minutes)

#### Output Data
- Input list
- Maximum sum contiguous sublist and its sum
- Time interval corresponding to the sublist

        lstData.add(cd3);
        lstData.add(cd4);
        lstData.add(cd5);

**Test 1:** Check if the method that will create the input list for the algorithm its running accordingly. 

	@Test
    void difArrivalLeaving() throws ParseException {
        int[] expected = {1,1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0};
        int[] inputList = perfAnalysis.difArrivalLeaving("5/30/2022" , 60 , lstData );
        for (Integer i : inputList) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
        assertArrayEquals(expected,inputList);

    }

**Test 2:** Check if the brute-force algorithm own made and provided its giving the expected results.

    @Test
    void computeMaxSublist() {
        BruteForce tf = new BruteForce();
        Benchmark bm = new Benchmark();
        int[] inputList = new int[]{29, -32, -9, -25, 44, 12, -61, 51, -9, 44, 74, 4};
        int[] maxSubList = perfAnalysis.computeMaxSublist(inputList , tf);
        int[] maxSubList2 = perfAnalyis.computeMaxSubList(inputList, bm);
        int[] expected = {51, -9, 44, 74, 4};
        assertArrayEquals(expected,maxSubList);
        assertArrayEquals(expected,maxSubList2);
    }

**Test 3:** Check if the method that calculates the sum of all elements of the max contiguous sublist its working properly.

    @Test
    void getSublistSum() {
        int[] inputList = new int[]{29, -32, -9, -25, 44, 12, -61, 51, -9, 44, 74, 4};
        int expected = 122;
        int result = perfAnalysis.getSublistSum(inputList);
        assertEquals(expected,result);
    }

**Test 4:** Check if the method that provides the time interval(start and end in the format HH:mm) of the max contiguous sublist its working properly.

    @Test
    void getSublistTimeInterval() {
        BruteForce tf = new BruteForce();
        int[] inputList = perfAnalysis.difArrivalLeaving("5/30/2022" , 60 , lstData );
        int[] maxSub = perfAnalysis.computeMaxSublist(inputList,tf);
        String expected = "[08:00 ; 12:00]";
        String result = perfAnalysis.getSublistTimeInterval(tf);
        assertTrue(checkIfEquals(expected,result));
    }
