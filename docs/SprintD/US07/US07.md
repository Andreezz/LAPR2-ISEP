# US 07 - As a nurse, i intend to record adverse reactions of a SNS User

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identify the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

> *US 07 - As a nurse, i intend to record adverse reactions of a SNS User*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

> *Question no.1*
> 
> *"in this US (07) , the registration of adverse reactions is simply by indicating the sns user that received the shot or we need to register the adverse reactions by sns user arrival time? By this, i meant, that the nurse registers sns user's adverse reaction by order of arrival, automatically, or the system is manual, like she/he needs to indicate the name and etc? "*
> 
> *Answer*
> 
> *The nurse identifies adverse reactions during the recovery period. But the nurse can register the adverse reactions whenever she wants.*

> *Question no.2*
> 
> *1 Question: The SNS User will record the reactions or it's only the nurse? 2 Question : The Nurse must select one SNS User and then write the reactions of that SNS User? 3 Question : When the Nurse will record those reactions?*
> 
> *Answer*
> 
> *If the nurse identifies any adverse reactions during that recovery period, the nurse should record the adverse reactions in the system. The nurse must enter the user's SNS number and must describe the adverse reactions.*

> *Question no.3*
> 
> *"What are the requirements for a sns user's adverse reactions to be recorded? Is it only necessary to confirm the existence of the chosen sns user or there's something else?"*
> 
> *Answer*
> 
> *"If the nurse identifies any adverse reactions during that recovery period, the nurse should record the adverse reactions in the system. The nurse must enter the user's SNS number and must describe the adverse reactions.*
### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

>*There were no given acceptance criteria*

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

> *There were no found dependencies*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

> *Input*
>
> snsnumber
>
> adversereactions



> *Output*
> 
> A message of successfull save: "The SNS User´s adverse reactions were saved with success"
> 
> A message of wrong input of data: "Couldn't save the SNS User´s adverse reactions please try again"
>
> A message where the input mistake was made and its justification
### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

> *The nurse administrates the vaccine shot*

> *Records the administration of the vaccine*

> *Consults the SNS Users in the waiting and recovery room*

## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 2.2. Other Remarks

> *The nurse administrates the vaccine shot*

> *Records the administration of the vaccine*

> *Consults the SNS Users in the waiting and recovery room*

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	Choosing an available option from the menu						 |  Nurse           |  The nurse will choose from the menu a available option                            |
| Step 2  		 |	Inserting the User in the selected option						 |  AdverseReacUI           | The UI has the function to get the user options working                             |
| Step 3  		 |	Giving the necessary information to adverse reactions registration						 | Nurse             |  The Nurse has the function to register adverse reactions                            |
| Step 4  		 |	Upload the information to the program						 | AdverseReacUI            |  The UI will make the connection between the User and the program                            |
| Step 5  		 |	Check the information given by the User						 |  AdverseReacStore           | The Store will have the function to check the information guven by the user (SNS Number)                              |
| Step 6  		 |	Save the information given by the User						 |  AdverseReacStore           |  The Store has the function to make the connects with the Company                            |              
| Step 7  		 |	Retain the information given by the User						 | Company            |   The Company has the function to store the information                           |
| Step 8  		 |	Information the User if the information was well inserted						 |  AdverseReacUI           |     The UI will make the connection between the User and the program                               |


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

> *AdverseReac*

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
> *AdverseReacUI*  
> 
> *RegisterAdreaController*
> 
> *AdverseReacStore*
> 
> *Company*

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![USXXX-SD](C:\Users\Miguel\IdeaProjects\lei-22-s2-1dn-g63\docs\SprintD\US07\US07_SD.png)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*

        AdverseReacStore AdRea = new AdverseReacStore();
        String actual= String.valueOf(AdverseReactions);
        String expected = String.valueOf(AdRea.createAdRea("123456789", "fever and pain in the head"));
        Assertions.assertEquals(actual, expected);

                AdRea.createAdRea( "123456789", "fever and pain in the head");
                AdRea.saveNewAdRea(AdverseReactions);
                String expected = String.valueOf(AdRea.getAdreaction());
                Assertions.assertEquals(expected, expected1);
                return false;
        }
      @Test
    void checkSnsNumber(){

        String validSNSnumber = "123456789";
        AdverseReac AdRea = new AdverseReac( invalidSNSnumber, "fever and pain in the head");
        AdverseReac AdvRea = new AdverseReac( validSNSnumber, "fever and pain in the head");

        Assertions.assertFalse(AdRea.checkSnsNumber());
        Assertions.assertTrue(AdvRea.checkSnsNumber());
