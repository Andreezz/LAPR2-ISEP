# US08 - Record the Administration of a Vaccine

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a nurse, I want to record the administration of a vaccine to a SNS user. At the end of the recovery period, the user should receive a SMS message informing the SNS user that he can leave the vaccination center.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 
#### From the specifications document:

- "The nurse checks the user info and health conditions in the system and in accordance with
  the scheduled vaccine type, and the SNS user vaccination history, (s)he gets system instructions
  regarding the vaccine to be administered (e.g.: vaccine and respective dosage considering the SNS
  user age group)."
- "... , each nurse registers the event in the system,
  more precisely, registers the vaccine type (e.g.: Covid-19), vaccine name/brand (e.g.: Astra Zeneca,
  Moderna, Pfizer), and the lot number used."
- "Afterwards, the nurse sends the user to a recovery room,
  to stay there for a given recovery period"
- "The system should be able to notify (e.g.: SMS or email) the user that his/her recovery period has ended."
- "The vaccine
  administration process comprises (i) one or more age groups (e.g.: 5 to 12 years old, 13 to 18 years
  old, greater than 18 years old), and (ii) per age group, the doses to be administered (e.g.: 1, 2, 3), the
  vaccine dosage (e.g.: 30 ml), and the time interval regarding the previously administered dose.
  Regarding this, it is important to notice that between doses (e.g.: between the 1st and 2nd doses) the
  dosage to be administered might vary as well as the time interval elapsing between two consecutive
  doses (e.g.: between the 1st and 2nd doses 21 days might be required, while between the 2nd and the
  3
  rd doses 6 months might be required).
  "


#### From the client clarifications :
>- **Question:** As we can read in Project Description, the vaccination flow follows these steps: 
>  1. Nurse calls one user that is waiting in the waiting room to be vaccinated; 
>  2. Nurse checks the user's health data as well as which vaccine to administer; 
>  3. Nurse administers the vaccine and registers its information in the system.
>
>   The doubt is: do you want US08 to cover steps 2 and 3, or just step 3?
>- **Answer:** 1.The nurse selects a SNS user from a list. 2. Checks user's Name, Age and Adverse Reactions registered in the system. 3. Registers information about the administered vaccine.


>- **Question:** To access the user info - scheduled vaccine type and vaccination history -, should the nurse enter user's SNS number?
>- **Answer:** The nurse should select a SNS user from a list of users that are in the center to take the vaccine.

>- **Question:** Supposing that the SNS user has already received a dose of a given vaccine type (for example, COVID-19), the user can only receive the same vaccine or a different one with the same vaccine type?"
>- **Answer:**  The SNS user can only receive the same vaccine.
>   Related information: 
>  - A SNS user is fully vaccinated when he receives all doses of a given vaccine.
>  - A SNS user that has received a single-dose vaccine is considered fully vaccinated and will not take more doses.
>  - A SNS user that is fully vaccinated will not be able to schedule a new vaccine of the type for which he is already fully vaccinated.

>- **Question:** The system displays the list of possible vaccines to be administered (considering the age group of the user); then the nurse selects the dose she is going to administer and gets information about the dosage. But wouldn't it be more correct, since the system knows the vaccination history, in other words, if the user has already take x dose(s) of that vaccine, to simply show the dose and the respective dosage and not ask for the nurse to arbitrarily select it?
>- **Answer:** If it is the first dose, the application should show the list of possible vaccines to be administered. If is is not a single dose vaccine, when the SNS user arrives to take the vaccine, the system should simply show the dose and the respective dosage.

>- **Question:** After giving the vaccine to the user, how should the nurse register the vaccine type? by the code?
>- **Answer:** A vaccine is associated with a given vaccine type. Therefore, there is no need to register the vaccine type.
   Moreover, the nurse should also register the vaccine lot number (the lot number has five alphanumeric characters an hyphen and two numerical characters (example: 21C16-05)).


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC1:** The nurse should select a vaccine and the administered dose number.
