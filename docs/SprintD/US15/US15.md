# US 015 - As a center Coordinator, I intend to check and export vaccination statistics

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identify the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

*As a center Coordinator, I intend to check and export vaccination statistics, I want to export to a csv file the total number of fully vaccinated users per day*

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

*Question:*
-*Do you want us to show the full vaccinated users in each individual day, or should we show the continuous sum of fully vaccinated users?"*
*Answer*
-*In a previous answer, the client specified the format of the data: "day, number of fully vaccinated". The client wants the total of fully vaccinated users per day.*

*Question*
-*"On this US we only have to do a funcionality that creates a csv file with the vaccination statistcs right?"*
*Answer*
-*I already answered this question. The center coordinator wants to check the statistics in the application and should be able to export to a CSV file.*

*Question*
-*"What do you mean by "check statistics"? Are they supposed to appear on the terminal or console?"*
*Answer*
-*I already answered this question. The center coordinator wants to check the statistics in the application and should be able to export to a CSV file.*
### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

*AC1: Show all users fully vaccinated*

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*Dependency from US06*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

##Input
*Vaccination center*
*FilePath*
*Date*

##Output

*CSV*

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*Verify if the csv exist if don´t exist return that can´t locate the csv*


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Verify if the csv exist if don´t exist return that can´t locate the csv* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for...            | Answer                  | Justification (with patterns) |
|:---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------|:------------------------------|
| Step 1  		     | 	requests to load a set of SNS users from a file						 |                         |                               |
| 		             | 						                              ...coordinating the US?                   | ExportCtrl              |                     |
| 		             | 							                         ...interacting with the actor?                       | ExportVaccinatedDailyUI |        |
| 		             | 							                          ...interacting with the actor?                       | ExportVaccinateDailyUI  |        |
| 		             | 							                          ...saving the file's path?                      | ExportStatistics        |               |
| Step 2  requests file's path	     | ...interacting with the actor?							                                                | ExportVaccinateDailyUI  |                               |              
| Step 3  	types file path	     | 	...saving the file's path?						                                                | ExportStatistics        |                               |
| Step 4  asks to confirm the file's path		     | ...interacting with the actor?							                                                | ExportVaccinateDailyUI  |                               |
| Step 5  confirms the file's path		     | 	...reading input?						                                                | ExportVaccinateDailyUI  |                               |
| Step 6  informs that the file was loaded in the system		     | ...interacting with the actor?							                                                | ExportVaccinateDailyUI  |                               |  


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * ExportStatistics
 * Company

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * ExportVaccinateDailyUI  
 * ExportCtrl

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![USXXX-SD](USXXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is  possible to load an instance valid 

	@Test
    void loadValidFile() {

        FileLoader validLoader1 = new FileLoader(PATH_FILE1);
        FileLoader validLoader2 = new FileLoader(PATH_FILE2);

        //checks if it is possible to load a valid file
        assertTrue(validLoader1.loadFile(false));
        //checks if it is possible to load a valid file
        assertTrue(validLoader2.loadFile(false));

    }
**Test 2:** Check if possivel check one path valid 

    @Test
    void checkFilePath() {

        FileLoader validLoader1 = new FileLoader(PATH_FILE1);
        FileLoader validLoader2 = new FileLoader(PATH_FILE2);

        //checks if it is possible to load a valid file
        assertTrue(validLoader1.loadFile(false));
        //checks if it is possible to load a valid file
        assertTrue(validLoader2.loadFile(false));

    }
    
**Test 3:** Check if its possivel create one invalid file path

    @Test
    void checkFilePath(){
    assertFalse(validLoader2.checkFilePath("src\\Full_vacinate.pdf"));
    }
